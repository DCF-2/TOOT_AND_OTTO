# TOOT AND OTTO GameS
This is an academic project developed for the Web Systems Development course. It is a complete implementation of the "Toot and Otto" board game, featuring PWA (Progressive Web App) capabilities, allowing it to be installed on devices and to function offline.

# üöÄ Features
Complete Rules: A faithful implementation of the "Toot and Otto" rules, including word formation horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

*Interactive Gameplay: A clean and intuitive interface for selecting pieces ('T' or 'O') and columns.
*Persistent Scoreboard: The win counter is saved in the browser's localStorage and persists between sessions.
*Progressive Web App (PWA):
*Installable: The game can be "added to the home screen" on mobile devices and desktops.
*Offline Functionality: It uses a Service Worker to cache all necessary files, allowing the game to be played even without an internet connection.

Responsive Layout: The design adapts to different screen sizes.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
-HTML5: Semantic structure of the application
-CSS3: Modern styling, using Flexbox for the layout.
-JavaScript (ES6+): Game logic, DOM manipulation, and PWA feature implementation.
-Service Workers: For cache control and offline functionality.
-Web App Manifest: To make the application installable.
